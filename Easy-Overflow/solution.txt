As we all know, strcpy doesn't check the bounds of the strings of the source and
destination, so it is very vulnerable to buffer overflow attack. Therefore that
is what we will use for this problem. We know that password is only supposed to
contain 30 chars, so we fill those up with A's or any other garbage char of your
choice, then we put in a C, with the ascii value of 67 to overflow into secret.
And with the shell we simply cat flag.
