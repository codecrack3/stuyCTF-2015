Two ways of doing this:
1. Using gdb you'll see the loading of a bunch of characters starting from
(0x12)($ebx) and you can set them in order and translate and find the flag.

2. Using the fact that the two parameters of strcmp is flag and message, we can
simply x/s $ebx when we break at the function.
