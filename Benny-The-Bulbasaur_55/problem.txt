Benny the Bulbasaur is a lv. 100 Bulbasaur with <a
href="/problem-static/Benny-The-Bulbasaur/bulbasaur.txt">these</a> stats
and can learn <a href="/problem-static/Benny-The-Bulbasaur/bulbasaur.in">these</a> moves, He is facing off against a lv. 100 Scizor
with a <a href="/problem-static/Benny-The-Bulbasaur/scizor.txt">these</a> stats.


But Benny the Bulbasaur can only use 4 moves against his enemy, please calculate
the maximum expected value of the damage (HP-wise) Benny can dish out against the scizor rounded to the
nearest integer. The flag format is stuyctf{maximum_expected_damage} (Also using
gen V type effectiveness, beware of that)


P.S. the formula for damage can be found <a
href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage#Damage_formula">here</a>
and for the purpose of this problem, "other" is 1 and the random multiplier is
also 1. Also assume no critical hits.


P.S. #2. the moves file is formatted as the following:

Name Type Physical/Special BasePower Accuracy


P.S. #3. In case you don't know what an expected value is:
Suppose random variable x can take on value of a with probability p and it can
take on value b with probability q, the expected value of x is equivalent to a *
p + b * q
