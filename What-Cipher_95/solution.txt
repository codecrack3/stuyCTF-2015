First, let's open up the ciphertext file. We immediately notice the distinct
Salted__ prefix to the ciphertext. A quick Google search reveals that this is a
sign of an OpenSSL encryption. Great, that narrows down the possibilities for
which cipher it could be, but there are still lots to try. There's no way we
want to do this manually so let's whip up a script (see admin/decrypt.sh) using
the openssl command line tool to decrypt the ciphertext, trying all combinations
of two lowercase alphabetical characters and OpenSSL ciphers. We know the plaintext
must have the string "stuyctf", so we just need to filter for decrypted output
that contains this string. After our script finishes executing, we get presented
with the flag:
stuyctf{openssl_is_4w3s0m3}
