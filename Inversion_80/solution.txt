so you know that there are only 90 possible radii for the inversion, so you
first make a decrypt program (like solution.py) based on the source code. Then
your loop through all possible radii with something like this:

for i `seq 10 99` ; do ./solution.py image.jpg.enc $i 0 0 ; done

Then one of the result is a real pic and there you've decrypted it.

Then you see that penguin is not the answer, this is another stego! If you hex
inspect it you'll notice that this is a zip file hiding inside the picture, so
you simply:

string blah.jpg

and you have the flag!
