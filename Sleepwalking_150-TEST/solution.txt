Some thinking and a search will lead you to Sleepwalking by Peter Hollens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih7Zh9YduRo

"This is an awesome song....

But you can't really have the nostalgia AND the happiness.  It's an either or type of thing.  Only one can be true for the statement to be true.

The text up above should hint that the cipher used is XOR but what's the key?
The equal signs show that's b64 encrypted, decrypted to "The key is the stupid default Windows filesystem type, all lowercase."
That should be ntfs.  XOR on the hex above with key ntfs gives:

"A frame within a frame within a frame... these six stories really take me high!"

Google search for frame story will yield a wikipedia article.  Reading through, or searching for six, will find you Cloud Atlas.

Now to the google form.

The first question is the final answer from youtube comment, which is of course Cloud Atlas (case sensitive)

The second is The Perfect Four: FLAC & MP3 320 & MP3 V0 & MP3 V2 help text merch
Playing with answer box will tell you to enter in the number of donor points squared times 30 + my year of birth
Googling The Perfect Four merch will lead you to: http://whatstore.portmerch.com/stores/

You'll quickly see the Perfect Four shirt, worth two donor points, and 120+1997 will give you 2117

Now the third question is a poem: The flag is near and so are you, so don't be sad and don't be blue, I know you hate me, don't be a diva, the middle school I went to is....

Digging through facebook until like 2010, or messaging specific old friends, or looking through my images and translating from Hebrew the album name of the one picture I have will probably yield the word Barkai.
Googling Barkai, will give you Barkai Yeshivah, which is the answer to the last one.

The flag is:
