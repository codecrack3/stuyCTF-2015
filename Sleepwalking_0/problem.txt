I really like Peter Hollens.
<blockquote style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0;">Alright guys, here's the deal with this problem.  Having a recon this hard was really controversial, and most of the team wasn't down with it.  Because the problem was already written, I polled the group, and it seemed like you guys wanted this.  It is hard.  It will take time.  You will want to kill me.

This question will serve as a tiebreaker, in the event of any ties.
In addition, the first two teams to solve and send me an explanation, will receive a prize from me.

zabari.daniel@gmail.com is where you should send your solution, after you've submitted the flag.

Good luck.

Also, so far only one team has solved it (I know it says two on the top but the counter can lie ;)
