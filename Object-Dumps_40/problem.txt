We're given a compiled binary for a program that was written in C. We want the function address of the 'func' function! Can you help us find it?

The binary is available here: <a href="/problem-static/Object-Dumps/dumper">dumper</a>

Please note that this problem is asking for the function address, so the standard flag format for this competition does not apply to this problem.
