OK so I encrypted the following article:
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/490.full

using encrypt.py, which is a custom substitution cipher.

The flag will be the name of the article, with spaces replaced by underscores (?)
i.e. The_end_of_privacy

To solve, one must use frequency analysis... The hint should be that this is
encrypted by a substitution cipher :D.
