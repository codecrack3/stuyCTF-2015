We've uncovered a long lost computer with a message on the side that reads "Password: RockBeatsScissorsBeatsPaper". Apparently this computer was made to play a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! But is it really that simple? Beat the computer to get the flag!

Luckily, we managed to obtain a <a href="/problem-static/Rock-Paper-Scissors/ai.pyc">compiled python file</a> that runs it!

The computer has been opened to the internet at <code>server.stuyctf.com:50000</code>
