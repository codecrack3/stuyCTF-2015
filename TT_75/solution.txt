If we open up the image file in a hex editor, we soon notice that the file
signatures are reversed! The JPEG header "FF D8" is at the end of the file, and
the JPEG trailer "FF D9" is at the start of the file. All we have to do is
reverse the file, so we can whip up a script like the one in gen.hs to reverse
the contents of a file. (bytewise)

After un-reversing the image, we open it up in an image viewer to find the flag
(which is upside-down):
stuyctf{topsy_turvy}
