Make a github.io page. Make a basic website with an ssh server address and a
username and password in the webpage,
commit, and push. Make a second commit removing the password.
Problem itself will just have the github.io link.

One the ssh server, with the address, username, and password that were on the
webpage, make a file with the flag in it.

i.e.

ssh git.stuyctf.com -l badgit
Password: 10fbf9e81f01de

$ ls
flag.txt

$ cat flag.txt
i_is_bad_at_git
